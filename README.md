Software Design Approach

I approach software design by first understanding the problem domain and user requirements, ensuring I create a clear blueprint of the system. I focus on modularity, designing the software in small, manageable components, which makes it easier to test, extend, and maintain. Prioritizing user experience is also key, ensuring intuitive interactions and clear navigation.

New Design Skills Developed

Working on my 2D animation and 3D scene projects, Iâ€™ve developed stronger skills in designing interactive elements, particularly in handling user input and implementing dynamic visual effects. Additionally, the experience enhanced my understanding of how to balance functionality and performance in rendering graphics.

Design Process Followed

For my project work, I followed an iterative design process, starting with wireframes for layout and user interaction, followed by feedback incorporation, testing, and refinement. I began with basic functional components and gradually added more complexity (textures, physics, and collision detection) as the project evolved.

Tactics Applied to Future Work

The modular approach and use of iterative refinement will be applicable to any future software projects, particularly those requiring rapid prototyping or real-time user interaction. This allows me to adapt quickly to changes and improve system functionality incrementally.

Program Development Approach

I approach program development by breaking down the task into smaller, manageable chunks. I outline the logic and expected behavior of the program before coding, then develop in iterations, continuously testing and adjusting.

New Development Strategies Used in 3D Scene

While developing the 3D scene, I used a physics-based approach to implement realistic object interactions, focusing on modular functions to control object movement, collision, and rendering. I also used state management to control different visual elements and interactions within the scene.

Iteration in Development

Iteration was central to my development process. Each feature was tested, refined, and adjusted as needed, allowing me to discover better ways to handle user inputs, improve rendering efficiency, and tweak object behaviors for a more interactive experience.

Evolution of Code Development Approach

My code development approach has evolved to emphasize the importance of testing and modularity. Early milestones required basic functionality, but as the project progressed, I learned to refactor and optimize my code, ensuring it was both efficient and easy to maintain. The iterative approach ensured that each milestone added new features without disrupting existing ones.

Role of Computer Science in Reaching Goals

Computer science plays a critical role in helping me reach my goals by equipping me with problem-solving, analytical, and technical skills necessary for designing, developing, and optimizing software applications. These competencies are essential for building complex systems like mobile apps or simulations.
